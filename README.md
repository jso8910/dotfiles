### Dotfiles
Welcome to my dotfiles! To install, just install paru, an aur client, from the aur, and then install yadm. run `yadm clone [url to this repo] --recursive` (note that `--recursive` is quite important because there are submodules) and then `cd scripts` from your home directory and run `./install.sh`. If it fails, just run `chmod +x install.sh`
